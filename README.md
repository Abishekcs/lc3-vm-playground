# LC3 VM From Scratch 🚀

This repository contains my implementation of the **LC-3 Virtual Machine** — built as a learning project while following the excellent guide at https://www.jmeiners.com/lc3-vm/.

The goal is to deeply understand how a simple CPU architecture works and to implement a working emulator from the ground up.

## 🧠 What Is LC-3?

LC-3 (Little Computer 3) is a minimalist educational CPU architecture widely used to teach computer architecture and assembly language. This project implements the LC-3 virtual machine including:

- 16-bit instruction decoding
- Memory management
- Register file
- Pipeline / execution loop
- Traps & I/O
